    <h2>Apology & Explanation Message</h2>
    <p>
        "I want to begin by apologizing, and I know what happend scared you, but I want you to know I understand youâ€™re going through tough times yourself. What happened was a horrendous mistake, and I wasnâ€™t trying to hurt you or scare you. It was completely unintentional.

        I've already lost you once, and I can't bear the thought of losing you again. I couldn't sleep all night thinking about this, and I realized I needed to find a way to apologize sincerely. You donâ€™t have to take any responsibility for me, I promise. I stayed true to my word when I said I wouldnâ€™t get attached,and i didnt.
        
        Please, Iâ€™m asking for one more chance. Nothing like this will ever happen again, I swear. Nothing from my side will ever bother you again.
        
        I still remember the first time I talked to you, and for the first time in my life, I got butterflies talking to someone. I always think about how lucky the people who had you must be. If I were them, Iâ€™d never let you go. because youâ€™re worth that and so much more.
        
        I will never, ever take you for granted. I promise that I won't let you go like they did. I wonâ€™t give up on you. Youâ€™re so incredibly special to me.
        
        What happened with me was scary, and I lost track of my thoughts completely. I got so overwhelmed and was scared, and in that moment, I completely forgot to inform you that I was going offline. It wasnâ€™t intentional, I just... panicked. I never meant to cause you any distress or make you feel abandoned.
        
        I know youâ€™ve already given me a chance, and I donâ€™t take that lightly. What happened was unprecedented, but if you can find it in your heart to give me one last chance, I will make sure I never disappoint you again. I wonâ€™t cause you any more trouble, and I donâ€™t want to lose you because of my mistake. This regret will haunt me for the rest of my life.
        
        Please forgive me, and I promise I will never, ever repeat this mistake. It was unintentional Nothing like this has happened before and i promise it wont happen ever again take your time i can wait as long as ive to for you ,just dont abandon me i know its difficult for you to forgive but i made a mistake i can only promise it wont happen again.
