    <h2>Apology & Explanation Message</h2>
    <p>
        I want to begin by apologizing. I know what happened scared you, and I truly regret it. I understand youâ€™re going through tough times, and the last thing I wanted was to add to your stress. It was a horrendous mistake, completely unintentional, and I never meant to hurt or scare you.

Iâ€™ve already lost you once, and I can't bear the thought of losing you again. I couldn't sleep last night, realizing how deeply this has affected you, and I want to find a way to make things right. You donâ€™t have to take responsibility for me, I promise. I stayed true to my word when I said I wouldnâ€™t get attached, and I didnâ€™t.

Please, Iâ€™m asking for one more chance. Nothing like this will ever happen again. Iâ€™ll make sure nothing from my side bothers you. I still remember the first time I talked to youâ€”I got butterflies. I always think about how lucky those who had you were. If I were them, Iâ€™d never let you go because youâ€™re worth so much.

I wonâ€™t take you for granted. I wonâ€™t give up on you. Youâ€™re so special to me.

What happened with me was scary. I lost track of my thoughts and got overwhelmed. I was too scared to inform you I was going offline, and in that moment, I panicked. It wasnâ€™t intentional. I never meant to make you feel abandoned.

I know youâ€™ve already given me a chance, and I donâ€™t take that lightly. If you can find it in your heart to give me one last chance, Iâ€™ll make sure this never happens again. I donâ€™t want to lose you over my mistake. This regret will haunt me forever.

Please forgive me. I promise this will never happen again. Take your time. Iâ€™ll wait as long as I need to, but please donâ€™t abandon me. I made a mistake, but I can promise it wonâ€™t happen again
