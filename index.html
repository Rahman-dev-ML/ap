      <!-- Write your own special text below -->
      <p> I want to begin by apologizing. I know what happened scared you, and I truly regret it. I understand you're going through tough times, and the last thing I wanted was to add to your stress. It was a horrendous mistake, completely unintentional, and I never meant to hurt or scare you.

        I've already lost you once, and I can't bear the thought of losing you again. I couldn't sleep last night, realizing how deeply this has affected you, and I want to find a way to make things right. You don't have to take responsibility for me, I promise. I stayed true to my word when I said I wouldn't get attached, and I didn't.
        
        Please, I'm asking for one more chance. Nothing like this will ever happen again. I'll make sure nothing from my side bothers you. I still remember the first time I talked to youâ€”I got butterflies. I always think about how lucky those who had you were. If I were them, I'd never let you go because you're worth so much.
        
        I won't take you for granted. I won't give up on you. You're so special to me.
        
        What happened with me was scary. I lost track of my thoughts and got overwhelmed. I was too scared to inform you I was going offline, and in that moment, I panicked. It wasn't intentional. I never meant to make you feel abandoned.
        
        I know you've already given me a chance, and I don't take that lightly. If you can find it in your heart to give me one last chance, I'll make sure this never happens again. I don't want to lose you over my mistake. This regret will haunt me forever.
        
        Please forgive me. I promise this will never happen again. Take your time. I'll wait as long as I need to, but please don't abandon me. I made a mistake, but I can promise it won't happen again
